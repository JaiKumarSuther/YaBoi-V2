# YaBoi V2

## What is YaBoi?

YaBoi is a Twitch view bot capable of many great things such as:

### Voice recognition
Bots could listen to the streamer and actually respond to what the streamer was saying in chat. This made my bots really hard to nail down as bots.

### Mention recognition
The bots knew when they were mentioned by other people and could respond in chat adequately.

### Realistic chat
We had realistic chats, you could select a game which you were streaming and the bots would talk about that specific game in chat. The chat was ripped directly from other streamers and each message was hand picked. Every message was applicable at any time.

### Follow bot
You could get followed by our bots

### Realistic cookies
I succesfully evaded "Kasada" with a bot called "Kasane" which I wrote. It was a google extension that would calculate and return a correct checksum for Kasada and thus evade it. It was capable of creating a 100 accounts in one hour. Each account had a picture and a description that was randomly generated and never repeated.

### 1Pixel exploit
I created this method in order to lower the CPU usage from Twitch. It basically meant that I shrunk the player to 1x1px in order to make it use less resources as YaBoiV2 ( the bot ) was BAS ( browser emulation ) based.

### CDP exploits
One more exploit I created for this bot was to open a new tab and hijack the first tab using CDP so I can lie to the browser that I am still active on that tab. This reduced the CPU usage by a ton.

### Kasada bypass
I managed to bypass kasada bot protection and create tons of Twitch accounts
